# -- DESCRIPTION --------------
# Run after most of gnome is up and running, ensures
# conky is started after a proper delay, as well as starting
# up the battery-indicator after awn is initalized for proper
# display.  Yes, it's a bug workaround.

# Just in case
killall avant-window-navigator
avant-window-navigator --startup &

# Let things settle down
sleep 30

/usr/lib/battery-status/battery-status --indicator &

# Fire up conky, which is called by another script
cd ~/.conky/ConkyGold
~/.conky/ConkyGold/conky.sh
